# Compressive-strength-of-Concrete
Concrete is the most common material used in civil construction, being a mixture composed of water, 
cement, different aggregates and some admixtures. Its resistance depends on factors such as cement 
consumption, water-cement factor, degree of condensation and the nature of aggregates. The 
compressive strength of concrete is quite considerable, but its tensile strength is much lower. 
The compressive strength of concrete is the basic component adopted for the strength and durability 
design and estimation of the service life of the structures in civil engineering projects.   
Compressive strength is one of the most widely used parameters in structural engineering for 
reinforced concrete structure design. However, this activity involves time, planning, and financial 
resources because the commonly used compressive strength is obtained on the 28th day. Therefore, 
the prediction of compressive strength using laboratory tests is challenging, uneconomical, and turns 
out to be time-consuming. 
Technological advancement allows engineering problems to be solved using machine learning 
methods. In general, artificial intelligence systems have shown their ability to solve real-life 
problems, particularly in nonlinear tasks. 
The machine learning model can obtain a solution to highly nonlinear complex problems with better 
efficiency by linking the provided input to the required output
 Three 
models were evaluated to determine their effectiveness: the Regression model, which yielded an R
squared value of 0.55, indicating a moderate ability, the Decision Tree model, which improved 
performance with an R-squared value of 0.75, showcasing its strength in capturing non-linear 
relationships; and the Neural Network model, which achieved the highest accuracy with an R
squared value of 0.87, demonstrating its superior capability in modeling complex patterns and 
interactions within the data. These results highlight the potential of neural networks for this task.
